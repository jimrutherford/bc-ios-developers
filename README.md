## British Columbia iOS Developers

British Columbia iOS Developers Slack is a place for iOS software developers who live or work in British Columbia to chat and support each other.

### How do I join?

The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing `jim@taptonics.com`.

### Why does this exist?

British Columbia iOS Developers Slack was created to foster the iOS software development community in British Columbia. We encourage sharing your knowledge, asking questions, forming relationships and a general ambition to strengthen the community.

### Am I eligible to join?

In short, yes! We are really open to having as many people that want to be a part, be a part. There are no hard rules on who is able to join and who is not. The only consideration is that the purpose of the group is to grow local and regional relationships. That means if have attended meet ups in BC, work for a company based out of BC, work with other developers in BC, or have some similar affiliation, join us!

### What are the rules?

Basically just be nice, treat others how you would like to be treated.

##### Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators by typing /admin <your message> in Slack, or contact an admin directly via DM. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
